# Survey on Performance Management

<p>Welcome to this survey about performance management. It aims to gather information about the current state of performance management for future research and research directions.</p>

<p>We invite you to participate if you are working in the industry, are involved in software development, and at least 18 years old. The participation is voluntarily, and we treat all data confidental.</p>

<p>The survey takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete with approximately 20 questions. It consists of two parts of which the following first part is about the current state of performance management.</p>

<p>We appreciate your participation and thank you in advance.</p>

### How do you currently manage performance in your team? \[C3PManagement\]

<p><em>Monitoring tools</em> take measurements of a software during its runtime in the production environment and allow to analyze the software's performance based on these measurements.</p>

<p><em>Performance tests</em> execute a part or the complete software with different workloads to measure the software's performance.</p>

<p><em>Model-based performance predictions</em> employ a performance model (e.g., a Petri net or UML) which represents a software and describes how resources are used. Based on such a performance model, different techniques predict the performance characteristics of the software.</p>

## Section: *New Tool*

Welcome to the second part. It consists of four questions about a new model-based performance prediction tool. This tool extracts a performance model from code and monitors the code in a test or production environment. Based on a training set from these measurements, the performance model is calibrated (i.e., its parameters are estimated). Afterwards, the tool performs a self-validation by predicting the performance and comparing the results with a validation set from the measurements. The comparison is based on statistical measures which express the accuracy of the performance prediction. If the prediction is accurate enough, the model can be used to analyze the software system. Otherwise, the monitoring and calibration continues until the self-validation estimates the prediction as sufficiently accurate.
